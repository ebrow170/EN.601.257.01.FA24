Game Summary: A one- or two-paragraph description of your game. If there are important story and/or character aspects, include them here.
	Goal of the game is going to be a world exploring game with a combat system. It will be a medieval theme. The established ideas for the game is that it will have various levels, with the first level starting as a base defense where the enemy invades, leading the playable character to explore different levels and fight various bosses/enemies. 
We were brainstorming enemy wave concepts or maybe more scattered enemies like Super Mario Galaxy, along with several unique bosses. We aim to implement some story and dialogue, and also a rudimentary elemental magic system. The playable character will be a knight, and we hope to add some level of customizability, especially with the weapons.
We wish to implement a health and mana system as well, along with various items if time/bandwidth permits.

Genre: The broad category your game will fall under. Examples include first-person shooter (FPS), real-time strategy (RTS), puzzle, rogue-like, etc. Can include multiple genres.
	3D platformer, action-adventure, combat
	Medieval fantasy, isekai (?) (mario galaxy style)

Inspiration: Describe any inspiration that will inform your game. This can include other games but also visual art and music. Include samples and link to all sources.
	Primary inspiration is Super Mario Galaxy (https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Galaxy)  and Castle Crashers (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vADEvc-e_7I) for mechanics, storyboarding, and level design. Super Smash Brothers Brawl: Subspace Emissary (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I40CmnIQemQ) for world map UI design, and Star Fox (https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/hands-on-preview/27220/star-fox-64-3d-nintendo-3ds) for dialogue UI design. Spellbreak (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1399780) for elemental magic system; visual art and music inspiration will depend on what assets we are able to find (plan to look on itch.io)
(idea: mario-style powerups that change userâ€™s elemental magic?) (A weapon can dictate the element?) (sword infusions?)

Gameplay: a paragraph describing how the player will interact with the game. Also use this section to broadly describe the expected user interface and game-controls. 
	The player will control one character, and will mostly not be able to interact with the environment, but can engage in combat with enemies. Ideally should be controller compatible. The player will be able to interact with certain characters and environmental features to engage in dialogue/with the narrative. The UI should contain at the least a health bar, mana, and a way to use items, as well as a profile of the current character. It will also contain a map screen where the player can select the current level.
